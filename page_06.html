        <h2>06.<h2/>
            <h4>I evoke the term ‘handmade web’ to suggest slowness and smallness as a forms of resistance.</h4>

            <p>In today's highly commercialised web of multinational corporations, proprietary applications, read-only devices, search algorithms, Content Management Systems, WYSIWYG editors, and digital publishers it becomes an increasingly radical act to hand-code and self-publish experimental web art and writing projects.
            <br><br/>

            The more proprietary, predatory, and puerile a place the web becomes, the more committed I am to using it in poetic and intransigent ways.
            <br><br/>
