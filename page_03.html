                I evoke the term ‘handmade web’ in order to advocate for an ongoing active

                Anil Dash writes: <i>In the early days of the social web, there was a broad expectation that 
                regular people might own their own identities by having their own websites, 
                instead of being dependent on a few big sites to host their online identity.</i>

            In February 2015 the online journal QUARTZ published an article with the provocative headline:
            <a href="https://qz.com/333313/milliions-of-facebook-users-have-no-idea-theyre-using-the-internet">Millions of Facebook users have no idea they’re using the internet</a>. As the article states: 
            <i>This is more than a matter of semantics. The expectations and behaviors of the next billion people 
            to come online will have profound effects on how the internet evolves.</i>

            <br><br/>

            In October 2014 the online journal GIZMODO published an article heralding The Great Web 1.0 Revival. 
            Its author Kyle Chayka observed: <br><br/><i>The booming size of today's mainstream social networks and the constant level of noise 
            we have to deal with has inspired a sudden return 
            to a time when the internet was quieter, safer, and more intimate… We're nostalgic for the close-knit, 
            DIY nature of the early web, where everything was smaller...</i><br><br/>
            The DIY aesthetics and practices of the mid-1990s have been embraced by the anti-social network TILDE.CLUB, 
            which hosts a small community of users on a single unix computer. For some, TILDE.CLUB serves as a platform for
             revisiting amateur web aesthetics in a contemporary context. For example, on her page, Olia Lialina invites users to view a new net 
             art work <a href="https://tilde.club/~olialia/">640x480</a> - a 4-tab browser installation. For many others however, 
             TILDE.CLUB has served as little more than a hip territory to occupy. 
             Many pages remain blank.

            <br><br/>
            In other corners of the internet, Web 1.0 aesthetics have never disappeared. 
            <a href="https://luckysoap.com">My own website</a>, including this page, which uses fixed-width table cells, is based on a template I created in HomeSite in 1997.
            <br><br/>
            Web 1.0 aesthetics persist in source code and stated objectives of the massive <a href ="https://www.ubuweb.com">Ubu Web site</a>, an "independent resource dedicated to all strains of the avant-garde, ethnopoetics, and outsider arts." On 16 December 2014, the founder of boasted on Twitter that "the whole damn site is still hand-coded in html 1.0 in bbedit, from templates made in 1996."
            <br><br/>
            I shall put off updating my website templates until out-of-date design is no longer cool.
